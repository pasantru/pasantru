`DevOps / Cloud Architect / SRE / SysAdmin`

DevOps Engineer specialized in architecting high-impact solutions. I leverage Azure, AWS, Kubernetes, and Terraform to build and scale resilient systems using KISS principles.

When I'm not architecting production environments, I'm usually breaking and rebuilding things in my **Homelab**—because breaking things in production is a privilege I prefer to keep to a minimum.

### These days I’m focused on:
- **Cloud Architecture** — Designing high-availability systems on Azure and AWS.
- **SRE & Automation** — Optimizing CI/CD pipelines and driving SLA reliability.
- **Homelab Experiments** — Self-hosting, networking, and testing emerging cloud-native tech.
- **Small, Thoughtful Scripts** — Building polished Bash and automation tools that just work.

### Core Stack:
`Kubernetes` `Azure` `AWS` `Terraform` `Python` `Bash` `Linux`
